        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/hamster.jpg" />
            </br>
            That's <span>Shosh</span>, my best friend. We're together ever since I remember myself. She's really so
            cool!!!</a>
        </div>
        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/cute-3161014_960_720.jpg" />
            </br>
            That's <span>Riki</span>, my beloved Granny. She's always worried about me, though I always try to prove her
            wrong - that I am a decent grown up. (But guess she's right.)</a>
        </div>
        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/cousin2.jpg" />
            </br>
            And here is <span>Moshiko</span>. He's the tughest guy I've ever met. He's not affraid of anything in the
            world. He can also jump so high! We all love him, even though sometimes he can really be a pain.</a>
        </div>
        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/dad.jpg" />
            </br>
            <span>Dad</span></br> One glance of him and you just know everything will be ok no matter what happens.
            Wish one day I'll be like him.</a>
        </div>
        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/broth1.jpg" />
            </br>
            Hey <span>Google</span>!!</br>
            This brother just finds everything everywhere. Look at his eyes! Can't hide nothing
            from him. And he also knows everything about everybody. An endless spring of information.</a>
        </div>
        <div id="guy">
            <img class="navigation" src="img/cousin1.jpg" />
            </br>
            And last comes <span>Snoopy</span>!!! Cutest sister ever. Love her so much!!! </br>
